# Hiconic

> This is a mixture of my thoughts and experiences developing _Hiconic_. For purely technical information see the [project's GitHub](https://github.com/hiconic-os).

* [What is Hiconic?](./hc-description.md) - basic overview of the technology

* [Why should anyone care about modeling stuff?](./hc-my-contributions.md) - it's super hard to explain to people what the value is, so I wrote some comparisons to other things that made a big impact

* [My personal contributions to the project (TODO)](./hc-my-contributions.md)

* [Convoluted history of the original company](./hc-history.md) - the (cautionary) tale of the company that was developing it internally
