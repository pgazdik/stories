# Welcome to my personal blog

I'm primarily a _Java_ developer with professional experience of building web apps with _[Grails](https://grails.org)_ and developing a model-driver framework _[Hiconic](https://github.com/hiconic-os)_.

This repo serves as a blog for my experience and thoughts.

## Topics

* [Hiconic](./hiconic/hc-intro.md) - thoughts on my 10 year journey developing the framework, and the model-oriented paradigm it's built on.
