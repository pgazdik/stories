# Looking for an exciting project

## Background

We were part of a very small team (~7 people) in a small Austrian company developing a custom application framework in Java (_[Hiconic](https://github.com/hiconic-os)_) and implementing numerous customer projects with it.

Technologically, our framework is very advanced. It beats numerous industry standards on performance, simplicity and flexibility. Even if not fully developed (compared to popular frameworks like `Spring Boot` or `Quarkus`) it is a testimony to our core team's tremendous efficiency and creativity.

Business-wise, the company's management considered healthy IT projects too boring and went a bit on the Adam Neumann path, so here we are.

## Who are we?

**Dirk Scheffler**

As a lead architect of both the framework and many customer projects, Dirk has IMHO shown superhuman mastery of technology. Besides having deep understanding of many technologies, he has a great intuition for robust and scalable solutions, which saves many days of exploratory work for entire teams.

**Christina Wilpernig**

Christina has the most experience leading customer projects. She was repeatedly involved in all the aspects - POCs, analysis, MVPs, implementation. On top of that she has often doubled as a project manager (sometimes even managing customer's teams) due to her attention to detail and being well organized.

 **Peter Gazdik**

I was working almost exclusively on our framework. My focus was high performance and reliability on the implementation side, and ease of use on the design side.

## What are we looking for?

We are not ones to advertise with a list of technologies. We have always used what we needed, often times squeezing every last bit of functionality by clever hacks.

We are looking for projects where we can leverage our ability to implement high performance, high reliability solutions. Projects where quality matters.

We are not trying to sell our framework, but it is of course available if desired, e.g. for supplementary tasks. We do not use it only for our web solutions, but also for our tools.
