# Looking for an exciting project

We are 3 Java developers with project experience in areas such as
* Enterprise Resource Planning
* Document Management System
* Payment Processing
* Insurance
* BPM Workflows
* System Integration

All these projects were implemented using our own application framework, developing which taught us a lot about good patterns and practices, efficiency and scalability.

We are now looking for new projects where we can leverage our skills, experience and passion for quality.

## Background

We were part of a small team (~7 people) in a small Austrian company developing a custom application framework in Java (_[Hiconic](https://github.com/hiconic-os)_) and implementing numerous customer projects with it.

This framework is an alternative to popular frameworks like `Spring Boot` or `Quarkus`. While not being as mature, it has a lot to offer and the fact it was developed by such a small team is a testimony to the team's efficiency and creativity. It is based on a novel implementation of model-driven paradigm, and beats numerous industry standards on performance, simplicity and flexibility. For more details (backing up these claims) see the  [the project's vision document](https://hiconic-os.github.io/hiconic.about/posts/vision.html).

Business-wise, however, the company's management considered healthy IT projects too boring and instead tried to find ways to disrupt the whole industry, with predictable results. So here we are.

## Who are we?

**Dirk Scheffler**

As a lead architect of both the framework and many customer projects, Dirk has in my opinion shown superhuman mastery of technology. Besides having deep understanding of many technologies, he has a great intuition for robust and scalable solutions, which saves many days of exploratory work for entire teams.

**Christina Wilpernig**

Christina has the most experience leading customer projects. She was repeatedly involved in all the aspects - POCs, analysis, MVPs, implementation. On top of that she has often doubled as a project manager (sometimes even managing customer's teams) due to her attention to detail and being well organized.

 **Peter Gazdik**

I was working almost exclusively on our framework. My focus was high performance and reliability on the implementation side, and ease of use on the design side.

## Why working with us?

**Full project commitment** - We are open to both short term consulting, but also long term project commitment. We can even become part of your core team, if your project has a larger scope.

**We solve all your problems** - While there's only three of us, we still keep professional relationships with our former colleagues who can be involved on demand. Their expertise covers areas such as **_cloud computing_**, **_DevOps_** and **_front-end_**.

**Startup mentality and efficiency** - If you are starting a project from scratch, you want a small, well coordinated team. We have years of experience working in an agile environment, with high quality delivered at fast pace.

<!-- 
We are not trying to sell our framework, but it is of course available if desired, e.g. for supplementary tasks. We do not use it only for our web solutions, but also for our tools.
